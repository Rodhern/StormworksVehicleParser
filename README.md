# Stormworks Vehicle Parser

A third party tool, made for fun, to read a Stormworks vehicle file and present some summary information. The result may be the count of the number of cubes used to build the vehicle, some crude size measurements, or a rough depiction of the space taken up by the vehicle.

## The purpose of the parser.

This is neither the first nor the best such tool. This parser tool is mostly an opportunity for me to play with Stormworks XML file content in two of my favourite software tools &mdash; F-sharp and Octave.


## Current state: Work in progress.

Notice that this tool is not even in a working state yet.
